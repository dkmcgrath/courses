## Introduction

Throughout this course, we have spent a lot of time looking at the tools and techniques often used by black hats. Obviously, the intent is for you to not use them with that motivation.

## What is this final, anyway?

What we will be doing for the final is write a paper answering the following questions:

* What is ethical hacking?
* Why is it important?
* In what ways can you ensure you always stay on the ethical side of hacking?
* In what ways can you be involved in ethical hacking?
* How does any of this apply to network security in general?

I'm looking for approximately 1500 words (total) on the above questions. Feel free to write more, if you feel you need the word count to adequately make your position clear.

## What to turn in

You will be submitting this via your gitlab repo, in a markdown file called `final/final.md`. Please ensure you have, at minimum, spell checked your document! This is a writing assignment, after all.
