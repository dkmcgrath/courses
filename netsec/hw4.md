# Find the Firmware!

## Introduction

Often, it is possible to tap the communication between a device and its update servers. In this way, you can capture the transfer of the updated firmware. If you are lucky, it's a full firmware that is transmitted, the update is over an unencrypted channel, and it's transmitted as a single HTTP session. Unfortunately, the ideal case is fairly rare. Increasingly, updates are delivered over secured connections, it's often just a delta or patch that is transmitted, and it's even sometimes transmitted in small chunks over multiple sessions.

## What you must do

Using the tools you've learned in this module, dissect the provided packet capture and extract the firmware. You will find the packet capture at `ada.cs.pdx.edu:/disk/scratch/dmcgrath/firmware.pcap`. Simply `scp` it to your VM (you could also use the workstations we used to crack Wi-Fi, if you wish). It is important to note that HTTP often transmits binary data via BASE64 encoding!

Some useful information regarding the firmware you're after:

Once you have a firmware extracted that matches the above, use a tool called `binwalk` to extract the contents (this isn't a reverse engineering class, use the `-M` and `-e` options), then answer a few questions:

1. What architecture is the firmware intended to run on?
1. What OS is the firmware running?
1. What users are present on the system?

Write a document detailing how you extracted the firmware, how you investigated the firmware, and answers to the above questions. Please make sure to include any code you wrote or commands you executed.

## Submission

Everything above should be documented in a markdown file in your repo called `hw4/hw4.md`. Commit and push this to your repo. Once you have done this, you can consider the assignment submitted.
